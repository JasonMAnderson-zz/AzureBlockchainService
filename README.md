# AzureBlockchainService

Azure Blockchain Service provides built-in consortium management through Powershell and the Azure Portal (view only functionality currently).  The Powershell cmdlets for consortium management are fairly straight-forward, but require some initial configuration before you can perform functionality such as inviting, removing or even viewing consortium information.  

Detailed guidance on how to use the Powershell cmdlets from Microsoft can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/blockchain/service/manage-consortium-powershell.

The Powershell scripts in this repo are quick and dirty shortcuts I use as we were developing the service as I was continually connecting to different members, which was tiring to setup manually each time.

Hope they're helpful for others to use as well!
